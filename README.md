# Linux 

pwd = you can check the current path

ls -la = this shows all files includes hidden files (begin ".")

ls --help = its helps :)

mkdir = folder


touch = file

"vi" visual editor(idk)
Basically, vi has 2 different modes: Command and Insert modes:

Command Mode: This mode allows you to use commands in order to interact with the file. For instance, go to a certain line of the file, delete certain lines, etc...
Insert Mode: This mode allows you to insert text into the file.
By default, vi opens with the command mode activated. In order to switch to the insert mode, you will have to type the character i.
Use the :w sequence first, in order to write the latest changes. After this, you will be able to exit the editor using the sequence :q.
Use the sequence :q!. This will exit the editor, ignoring the last changes to the file.
